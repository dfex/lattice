# lattice
```lattice``` is an experimental toy for database-driven network programmability.

```lattice``` takes network device(s) and loads operational information (interface names, protocol statuses etc) into a SQL (Lite) database, so that higher layer tools can access and process this data in a meaningful way.

Instructions to follow, once I've decided how it's going to work ;)
