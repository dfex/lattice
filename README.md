# lattice
```lattice``` is an experiment in Database-driven network programability.

In its simplest form, ```lattice``` takes network device(s) and loads operational information (interface names, protocol statuses etc) into a SQL (Lite) database, so that higher layer tools can access and process this data in a meaningful way.

```lattice``` is the foundation layer of a number of projects i've had in the back of my mind for some years now and will hopefully kickstart development of some of them!
